# Introduction
The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the materials and knowledge that reflect the curriculum of Machine Learning and Pattern Classification (ESE417 FL2021) at Washington University in St. Louis. The curriculum covers to students a mathematical and practical unerstaning of machine learning; This paper examines the performance of **support vector machines** and **random forest classifiers**, two classification methods of machine learning that are covered in 
## Dataset Description
The dataset being utilized is the red wine quality data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset consists of 1599 samples of red wine north from Portugal. 
Each sample consists of the target feature, the quality of the wine, rated from 3 to 8, and eleven other features;
<ul>
  <li>Fixed Acidity</li>
  <li>Volatile Acidity</li>
  <li>Citric Acid</li>
  <li>Residual Sugar</li>
  <li/>Chlorides</li>
  <li>Free Sulfur Dioxide</li>
  <li>Total Sulfur Dioxide</li>
  <li>Density</li>
  <li>pH</li>
  <li>Sulphates</li>
  <li>Alcohol</li>
</ul>

# Methods
## Support Vector Machine
## Random Forest Classifier

There are three main hyperparameters for the random forest classifier:
<ul>
  <li>Fixed Acidity</li>
  <li>max depth. By the limiting the depth of individual decision trees, 'overfitting' on training data can be avoided. </li>
  <li>criterion. The criterion is the method by which the classifier decides which feature to make the decision feature for the root node of a tree. The two criterions available are entropy and gini.</li>
</ul>
